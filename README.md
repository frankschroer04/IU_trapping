# Ion Trapping

A good portion of this code was written during my time (current) in the Richerme Lab at Indiana University. Some of the code is my own and others were a collaboration. I'll be sure to give credit to my wonderful lab mates when relevant. I have no real intention with this portion of my GitHub other than maybe the code will help you, the reader. I hope you find something here that is of use! 

P.S. I'm just OK at writing code. So if you ever notice that something can be written smoother, please let me know at frankgschroeriv@gmail.com.
