# Ion Trapping

A good portion of this code was written during my time (current) in the Richerme Lab at Indiana University. Some of the code is my own and others were a collaboration. I'll be sure to give credit to those who colloborated with me on these works :)

I have no real intention with this portion of my GitHub other than maybe the code will help you, the reader. Hope you find something here that is of use.
