# Ion Trapping

A good portion of this code was written during my time (current) in the Richerme Lab at Indiana University. Some of the code is my own and others were a collaboration. I'll be sure to give credit to my wonderful lab mates when relevant. I hope you find something here that is of use! 

P.S. I'm just OK at writing code. So if you ever notice that something can be written smoother, please let me know at frankgschroeriv@gmail.com.

Here are a list of fun ideas I'd like to tackle in my free time with regards to ion trapping  (if any of these also interest you, let's collaborate!):
1) Make a trap that can host two, 2D crystals. This would provide a native platform for quantum simulation of bi-layer materials. Start with some idealized trapping potentials and acquire equilibrium positions. From this, find the minimal terms in the axial potential required for this crystal arrangement. Let this influence the number of DC electrodes required for the CAD model. Once CAD model is complete, run it through COMSOL and then find a voltage set that gives the desired crystal arrangement. 
2) Instead of using an oscillating quadrupole, what if you used an oscillating quadrupole and an oscillation octopole? How would micromotion be affected? Could you achieve higher secular frequencies?
3) Run a simulation of sending entangled photons to two seperate ion traps and see if you can do something clever to result the ion's being entangled.
4) Can quantum singular value transform algorithms be sped up using native trapped-ion characteristics? I have a feeling that using digital-analog quantum computing you could get a speed up creating a block encoding.
5) What are vaious ways to increase the trap depths of a surface trap that doesn't require a grounding plane? Making the RF/DC electrodes offset from each other in the vertical direction? Make a surface trap in CAD and simulate the electrostatics using COMSOL. Find trap depths.
6) Make a sophisticated surface trap that can produce reasonable secular frequencies. Something similar to the surface trap David Allcock designed during his time at Oxford would be good enough for my liking.
7) Board games are fun. I wonder if there are specific board games that can inspire new 2D surface trap electrode arangments that would make swapping and shuttling more efficient?
8) Can cooling be quicker if we operate outside of the Lamb-Dicke Regime? I feel like this shouldn't work but who knows.
9) Scaling to thousands of qubits would require an electrode array on the size of meters. This seems like an imporprobable outcome. What if you could pack ions in 3D, or shuttle an ion over an ion? (This seems incredibly hard)
10) Create a white paper that explores the point at which quantum computers are useful.
