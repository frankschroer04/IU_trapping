Trap fabrication has been my primary focus during my time at Indiana University. In colloboration with Ilyoung Jung and Antonis Kyprianidis, we have desgined and assembled an ion trap that can host a wide suite of ion geometries that extends the native ion-ion interactions in typical macroscopic Paul Trap. I have specifically designed the electrode's and inner/outer workings of this ion trap using Solidworks. The electrostatics was simulated by Ilyoung using COMSOL and the fidelities of various quantum simulation experiments was calculated by Antonis. On a personal note, this is my proudest achievement in my career thus far!

Once when the entire CAD model is polished and we have successfully trapped ions (hopefully by the end of Fall 2025) I will upload a zip file containing the entire model with its blueprints. But for now (6/23/2025) some basic pictures and electrode substrate files will have to do.
