In our lab we use a PMT and an EMCCD camera to capture data from our ion's fluorescence. This is some old code of mine so I apologize if it is unorganized. This code will tell you where the ion's are located (ROIs), and state preperation fidelities.

This was was my first project in the lab so I have some nostalgia with this project!
