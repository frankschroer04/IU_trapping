This folder contains code that calculates various quantities in our lab that are useful for analyzing and conducting studies of quantum simulation using trapped ions. 


QSIM.py 
This code takes in secular frequencies, calculates equilibrium positions, and then calculates the normal mode spectrum. From here, our Ising Hamiltonian is created (using QuTip) and state dynamics and other quantum operations can be performed. Note, this code only calculates the equilibrium positions for a linear chain trapped in a harmonic axial potential.

QSIM2D.py 
This code is similiar to QSIM.py, however, it can calculate the equilibrium positions of linear chains and 2D crystals. This code was written in collobration with A.J. Rasmusson and Ilyoung Jung.
